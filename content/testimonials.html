  testimonials:
    - author: "James Baker, University of Southampton"
      quote: "Working with Dreaming Spires was a real pleasure. They responded to a (very tight!) time bounded request with real enthusiasm and after our initial meeting I felt confident they could deliver without too much back and forth. The final product met my needs, and the support I received after delivery was attentive and patient."
    - author: "Karla Cervantes Barron, University of Cambridge"
      quote: >
        I have worked with Dreaming Spires three times so far to expand the capabilities of our model Mat-dp (Material Demand Projections). Each project has had a set of requirements to fulfill, from identifying the best approach to design a user-friendly interface to creating an open-source software package.
        <br><br>The staff at Dreaming Spires have been friendly and knowledgeable in industry best practices and have applied them to our projects. Together, we have defined the project requirements and have made progress at each stage. I have also personally learned a lot from Mark Todd about tools for professional software development.
        <br><br>I would highly recommend working with Dreaming Spires to get academic software to become widely usable and well documented.
    - author: "Jeremy Green, King's College London"
      quote: "I found the Dreaming Spires team immediately engaged with my project and understood the requirements and issues that mattered to me. They worked well and collaboratively during the development of the code and were attentive with their follow-up and post-contract support. They even helped with writing a pitch document for getting funding to extend the capabilities of the software."
