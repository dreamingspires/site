If you have any questions, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:contact@dreamingspires.dev">contact@dreamingspires.dev</a>.

This Privacy Policy applies only to our online activities and is valid for visitors to our website with regards to the information that they shared and/or collected in Dreaming Spires. This policy is not applicable to any information collected offline or via channels other than this website.

#### What we collect and why

In your usage of the site, we store certain information about the pages you visit without correlating it to you.
In particular, we use a self-hosted <a href="https://github.com/usefathom/fathom">Fathom analytics</a> server, which collects the following information:

* The page you visit
* The referrer page
* The time of visit

We identify unique visitors by pseudo-anonymising this data, correlating by a unique hash of:

* IP address
* User agent
* Hostname

For more details, see the Fathom <a href="https://usefathom.com/data">data page</a>.

#### How we share your information with third-parties

We do not share any information with third parties, except with your explicit permission (e.g. the publication of blog posts and testimonials).

#### How to access and control the information we've collected

You may submit a request via email to <a href="mailto:contact@dreamingspires.dev">contact@dreamingspires.dev</a> to request an archive of the information we've collected about you, or to request that we remove any information we've collected about you.
