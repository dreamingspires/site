We joined with researchers at the Nuffield Department of Health on building [Global Pathogen Analysis System (GPAS)](https://gpas.global/) in order to provide critical tooling to response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our role was to assist the team in turning Scalable Pathogen Pipeline Platform (SP3), an academic toolset, into industrial-grade software through migration of their database to Oracle and assisting in the development of a Flask web front end.
This was then made available as a [free resource](https://web.archive.org/web/20210922212014/https://www.gpas.cloud/) to help combat COVID-19.

> GPAS is already supporting the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences in Canada, Chile, Vietnam, Australia, South Africa and Tanzania. It has the capacity to process 70,000-100,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences/day, enabling us to monitor which variants (e.g. Alpha, Delta) are causing SARS-CoV-2 infection globally. We plan further rollout of GPAS to fight other major global disease-causing microbes, such as tuberculosis. These analyses can be used real-time to support national and international public health efforts.
