We joined with researchers at the Nuffield Department of Health on building [Global Pathogen Analysis System (GPAS)](https://gpas.global/) in order to provide critical tooling to response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our role was to assit the team in turning Scalable Pathogen Pipeline Platform (SP3), an academic toolset, into industrial-grade software through migration of their database to Oracle and assisting in the development of a Flask web front end.
This was then made available as a [free resource](https://web.archive.org/web/20210922212014/https://www.gpas.cloud/) to help combat COVID-19.
