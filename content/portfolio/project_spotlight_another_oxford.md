Auditory hallucinations can appear in a number of different psychiatric disorders.
However, for people who haven't experienced these symptoms, it may be difficult to understand and empathise with the impact on daily life this causes.

At Dreaming Spires, we're excited to announce the release of our latest mobile app:

### Another Oxford

You can find it, currently available, on all major mobile app stores.

Created in partnership with the Oxford Ideas Festival, Another Oxford is designed to give insight into the day-to-day experiences of those who experience auditory hallucinations through walking tours across the city of Oxford.

Similarly to Oxford Mindmap, its sister app, users can explore an interactive map of the city, but do so along several marked walking tours.
These tours will take users past areas of interest in the city, where location-specific hallucation events can occur.

The walking tour routes reveal the unique culture and history of the city through their destinations, with a backend designed for easy modification and over-the-air updates to the app, allowing new routes and sound effects to be added on the fly.

We encourage you to check out Another Oxford if you're ever in Oxford, and want to understand life through the ears of those who suffer from these auditory hallucinations.
And if you're curious, or want to make use of our code, you're welcome to: the source code for the project on our public repository.
