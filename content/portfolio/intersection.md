The feature of an intersection type is something that has been a desire of the core python community. Recently, we've been working to try and develop a consistent description of an Intersection Type alongside other members of the open source community.


This is something that's still in progress, and there are many challenges to still overcome, but you can take a look at the draft PEP developed by us [here](https://github.com/CarliJoy/intersection_examples/pull/49).
