We collaborated with Lisn, a healthcare startup looking link patients' feedback into actionable changes which are valuable for healthcare professionals.
We're proud to have been selected to build the scalable feedback platform back end, and user interfaces for both the patients and healthcare providers.

The resulting product has been selected for a first pilot study with the Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, which is soon to be transitioning to the John Radcliffe hospital; the team is also eligible for the NHSX AI Award.
