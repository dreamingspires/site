Recently Dreaming Spires has contributed upstream code to Gensim, the Python library for topic modelling and natural language similarity retrieval.
In the process of building a larger language matching project with King's College London, [an issue](https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/issues/3270) was discovered which prevented LSI models from being initialised under certain conditions.

Mark has worked on and implemented a fix, which has been [accepted upstream](https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/pull/3271).
