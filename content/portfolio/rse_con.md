This year, we were very excited to be one of the sponsors of RSECon24. Over the course of the 4 day RSE conference in Newcastle, I met so many people in the research software sector, who care about producing high quality software just as much as we do.

There were lots of interesting talks at the conference, and we even got to give a short one ourselves, to tell people a little bit about Dreaming Spires.

We're very much looking forward to the next one in 2025, and hope to be involved again!
