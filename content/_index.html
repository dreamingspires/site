          I found the Dreaming Spires team immediately engaged with my project and understood the requirements and issues that mattered to me. They worked well and collaboratively during the development of the code and were attentive with their follow-up and post-contract support. They even helped with writing a pitch document for getting funding to extend the capabilities of the software.
