          I found the Dreaming Spires team immediately engaged with my project and understood the requirements and issues that mattered to me. They worked well and collaboratively during the development of the code and were attentive with their follow-up and post-contract support. They even helped with writing a pitch document for getting funding to extend the capabilities of the software.

    - title: EPIONCHO-IBM
      subtitle: Population modelling for disease
      iconname: fa-virus
      textcontent: EPIONCHO-IBM is a disease model of onchoceriasis. It is used to simulate the way this particular disease spreads through a population. From the simulation, predictions can be made about the best point to give treatment in the real world. <br><br> For this project, Dreaming Spires were given a piece of existing R code that represented the correct algorithm, and refactored this into a much faster Python model. As part of the refactor we made several optimisations to the code that resulted in a factor of 10 speed increase. The now accelerated project is currently being used to plan treatment programmes in this sector.

    - title: The PyETR Project
      subtitle: A model for human reasoning
      iconname: fa-brain
      textcontent: The book Reason and Inquiry by Philipp Koralus, McCord Professor of Philosophy and AI at the University of Oxford, presents a mathematical theory of the human capacity to reason. Over the course of the PyETR Project, at Dreaming Spires we helped Koralus' research group develop this into a Python package that performs the same operations. <br><br> This package allows users to translate strings that represent each problem into Python objects, before performing a series of operations that simulate human reasoning patterns. The package will be open-source and ready for release soon – watch this space!

    - title: Mat-DP-Pipeline
      subtitle: Data processing for CO₂ usage
      iconname: fa-cloud
      textcontent: When discussing issues around CO₂ production, frequently the operations of power plants and solar farms are analysed. Less discussed are the materials that go into these plants and farms - in this project we designed a tool for investigating how much CO₂ the materials used create. <br><br>However, many of the pre-existing data sets displayed the same information in different ways. At Dreaming Spires we created a pipeline to convert each data set into a "Standard Data Format", before processing this information, and displaying the results in a dashboard built in Python Dash.
